FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
ON people.show_id = titles.show_id
WHERE titles.title = 'Bright Star'; 

--5. What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made?
SELECT title, MIN(release_year)
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie'
GROUP BY title, release_year
ORDER BY release_year asc
LIMIT 1;
