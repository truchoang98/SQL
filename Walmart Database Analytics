--For this project, I downloaded Walmart data from Kaggle. 
--Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/walmart-dataset
--Then, I created a table in order to insert Walmart data. 
--Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

--Create a table. 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Walmartsales (
ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, 
Store INTEGER NOT NULL,  
Weekly_Sales INTEGER NOT NULL, 
Holiday_Flag INTEGER NOT NULL, 
Temperature INTEGER NOT NULL, 
Fuel_Price INTEGER NOT NULL, 
CPI INTEGER NOT NULL, 
Unemployment INTEGER NOT NULL
); 

1. Which store had the highest total weekly sales? 
SELECT Store, SUM(Weekly_Sales) AS total_sales
FROM BIT_DB.Walmartsales
GROUP BY Store
ORDER BY SUM(Weekly_Sales) DESC
LIMIT 1; 

2. What is the average CPI for Store 1? 
SELECT Store, AVG(CPI) AS average_cpi
FROM BIT_DB.Walmartsales
WHERE Store = 1; 

3. How many stores are in the database?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Store) FROM BIT_DB.Walmartsales; 

4. Which stores have a unemployment rate higher than 8? 
SELECT Store, Unemployment FROM BIT_DB.Walmartsales
WHERE Unemployment > 8; 

5. Which store has the lowest fuel price?
SELECT Store, Fuel_price
FROM BIT_DB.Walmartsales
GROUP BY Store
ORDER BY Fuel_price DESC
LIMIT 1; 

6. How many holiday flags are there? 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Holiday_Flag)FROM BIT_DB.Walmartsales;
